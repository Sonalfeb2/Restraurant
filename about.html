<h1>About Us</h1>
<p> Making sure that everyone feels taken care of. Finding a few moments to enjoy life is hard, so we’re here to make sure that you get the most of your time with us. This is a place where friends, families, and sports lovers with an appetite can come together to celebrate the big victories and the little wins over a great meal.  Enjoy over 80 crowd pleasing menu items like our gourmet pizza, pasta, burgers, wings and a cold beverage while watching a game. 

Nothing beats the thrill of cutting loose and seeing a game up close, so we went and did the next best thing — our multiple big screens guarantee a great view from any seat, and the food and parking here are way better than being at the stadium anyway. And even if you can't be here, you can experience Boston's at home with our pickup & delivery services</p>
